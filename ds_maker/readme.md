# IDM - DATASET MAKER
This folder contains the dataset 'harvester' for the IDM. we use the MSS library, and pygame, and just detect **controller** input, then map it to the frame. Each frame is saved as base64, in 5 frame chunks. 

## Official Dataset Information
The official dataset uses BeamNG.Drive as the simulator of choice for the official dataset. Due to the nature of the game, the dataset creator (mikus) had to drive for a total of 2.5~ hours, and was made using the same car in each map, and the maps being all official maps. There is 1 user-submitted map in the dataset. Around 40 minutes of frames is in the dark, and the rest is in the day, with clear weather. (or fog)
